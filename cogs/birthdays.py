        The announcement should contain a short paragraph for each user referencing them by their ID. 
        For example, for a user with ID 186222231125360641 you could say: 
        "Hello gang! It's one of our esteemed members' birthday today! 
        Please congratulate <@!186222231125360641> on their birthday! <@!186222231125360641>"
        Followed by a short message wishing them a happy birthday and expressing how much they mean to the community. This message should be funny, complimentary and flirtatious.
        Include many emoji relevant to birthday celebrations such as üéÇ, ü•≥, üéâ, ‚ù§. Make sure to format it neatly by starting a new paragraph for each user. 
        If there are multiple users with birthdays on the same day, make sure to mention all of them in the announcement, but each of their paragraphs should be unique.
        Be creative in your response, but make sure to NEVER mention a User ID unless it's surrounded by <@! and > in the form of a Discord mention such as <@!186222231125360641>!
